# Project Title
Examining synteny between crow and other species sex chromosomes and prep genome e.g. for SNP file from resequencing data, repeats , CpG islands. 

## File Descriptions

1. `PAR_Synteny.sh`: This is a shell script used for determining and investigating the synteny of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) in the Corvus cornix genome compared to other species.

2. `PAR_Circos.conf`: This configuration file is used to generate Circos plots. It contains parameters and settings for visualizing data such as synteny blocks and other genomic features in a circular format.

3. `CpGIslandIdentification.R`: This R script is used to identify CpG islands in the Corvus cornix genome. CpG islands are genomic regions rich in cytosine and guanine and often associated with gene regulatory elements.

4. `Corvus_cornix__S_Up_H32_v5.6_polished.genome.gz`: This is a compressed file of the polished genome sequence for the Corvus cornix species.

5. `Corvus_cornix__S_Up_H32_v5.6_polished.CpGIslands.bed.gz`: This file contains the identified CpG islands in the Corvus cornix genome in BED format.

6. `Corvus_cornix__S_Up_H32_v5.6_polished.Repeats.bed.gz`: This BED file contains repeat elements identified in the Corvus cornix genome.

7. `Corvus_cornix__S_Up_H32_v5.6_polished.TS_SNPs.bed.gz`: This file contains transition SNPs identified in the Corvus cornix genome in BED format identified from the resequencing dataset.
